# AirlinesBookingSystem
One of my University Projects were I Managed and overseed. This is  an Airlines booking system that  implements the basic functionality of booking a person for a filght using javafx.
It has 2 interfaces (Flight Cordinators , customers). A Flight coordinator has the ability to do CRUD opperations on the system were  passengers choose were to go. 
It uses soket programing to communicate to a MySql database to fetch data.
