# AirlinesBookingSystem
One of my University Projects were I Managed and overseer. This is an Airlines booking system that implements the basic functionality of booking a person for a flight using javafx. It has 2 interfaces (Flight Coordinator's , customers). A Flight coordinator has the ability to do CRUD operations on the system were passengers choose were to go. It uses Socket programing to communicate to a MySQL database to fetch data.
How to use:
The java file is found in "AirlinesGui" file. Make sure to run the file in Intelij Platform.
and run the "server" class first and then the "main" class next for bookair to work.The database file is found below the File "AirlinesGUI".
NOTE: The database sould be running first from all the process for bookair to  create a connection to fetch data from it.
